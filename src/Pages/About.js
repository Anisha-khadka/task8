            There's no greater feeling than coming back to work to an empty
            trash can after stuffing your receptacle with the previous day's
            food, paper, and other refuse. Tasks like trash removal and other
            janitorial services add up and leave your business in a radiant
            condition. With more than 30 years of experience, we have ensured
            customer satisfaction by taking to heart every customer's feedback.
            We strive to improve the way cleaning is done in Birmingham,
            Alabama. Make CCC your first choice for commercial cleaning.
